# Enhancements Tracker

This directory contains proposals for features/enhancements to
components which generally address the CNF/edge/RAN use case but which
are narrower in size, scope, and impact than would be covered in the
[OpenShift Enhancements](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements)
repository from which this directory is heavily inspired and derived.

The intent of this directory is to move discussions over features and
design decisions into an open and collaborative forum where anyone may
contribute. Participation by anyone who is interested is highly
encouraged.

New enhancements should use the example [OpenShift Enhancement
Template](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/guidelines/enhancement_template.md)
